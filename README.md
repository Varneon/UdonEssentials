UdonEssentials is an evergrowing collection of Udon prefabs for VRChat worlds that I think everyone should have at their disposal.

If you would like to test the prefabs in game, feel free to visit this world: https://vrchat.com/home/world/wrld_62e85ddd-65be-4676-83bd-3879347f4eb5

List of the prefabs:
| Name | Description | Set-up difficulty |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| Simple Player Settings | Simple, but more advanced replacement for the original "VRCWorldSettings" UdonBehaviour that ships with VRCSDK | Drag & Drop |
| Playerlist | List that shows all players in the instance, player count, player join times, instance lifetime and master | Drag & Drop |
| Music Player | Music player that allows world creators to create playlists for their worlds for everyone to listen to | Beginner |
| Groups | UdonBehaviour for establishing in-game groups which can be accessed from other UdonBehaviours | Beginner |
| Console | In-game console for showing custom logs in realtime while inside the world | Intermediate |
