Varneon's UdonEssentials - Udon Console

This prefab is an in-game console based on the one found in Unity Editor and is made for debugging UdonBehaviours during runtime either for development purposes or for showing behind-the-scene data to a user in a world

The console has public methods that you can access from your scripts to log different types of messages


How to use the console:

1: Copy and paste the necessary variables and proxy methods provided in the example script located in the "Examples" folder into your UdonSharpBehaviour

2: Use the log proxy methods in any part of your code by using to send messages to the console if one exists and is assigned

3: Place the "Console" prefab into your scene and assign it to the UdonBehaviours you want to use to send messages to it
